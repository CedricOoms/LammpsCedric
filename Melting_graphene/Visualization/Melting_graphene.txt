DynamicBonds: cut-off distance = 1.8

Timestamps are rough estimates (subjective):
From around frame 20 500 bonds are rapidly momentarily broken and repaired 
all over the graphene sheet.
These occurences increase as temperature further increases, but the sheets
remains intact.
At approx frame 57 219 the top left corner of the sheet breaks off 
(picture: 'break')
